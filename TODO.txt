TODO:
1. Make clusters and fields work the same way so that methods for plotting and distance calculation can be re-used

2. Should clusters really be taking the average of the CPB counts? maybe instead it should just be summing it up.

3. Should I essentially make a 3D csv for yearly data? Or is it fine to just have it as such with each year being a separate csv?



4. Find potential function to use for estimating data:

One thing to ask: Why is the missing data missing?
when do we have data for certain fields and when do we not have that data

Based on this information, can we just assume that the missing data is missing at random ? 

The grant paper said we will have 4 data collection periods: 2015, 2019, 2023, and 2027. Why is a lot of the data from the years between?
